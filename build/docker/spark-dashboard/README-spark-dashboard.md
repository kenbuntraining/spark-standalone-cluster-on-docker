# Spark Performance Dashboard
## Run as a Docker container or on Kubernetes using a Helm Chart 

This repository supports the installation of an Apache Spark Performance Dashboard using containers technology.  
Use for measuring and troubleshooting Apache Spark applications.   
Tested with Spark 3.x and 2.4.  

Two different installation options are packaged in this repository, use the one that suits your environment best:
- [**dockerfiles**](dockerfiles) -> Docker build files for a Docker container image, use this to deploy the Spark Dashboard using Docker.
- [**charts**](charts) -> a Helm chart for deploying the Spark Dashboard on Kubernetes.

The Spark Dashboard collects and displays Spark workload data exported via the [Spark metrics system](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics).
Metrics are collected using InfluxDB and displayed using a set of pre-configured Grafana dashboards.  
Note that the provided installation instructions and code are intended as examples for testing and experimenting.
Hardening the installation will be necessary for production-quality use.

## Install and run the dashboard

Using Docker:
 - Quickstart: `docker run --network=host -d lucacanali/spark-dashboard:v01`
 - Details: [dockerfiles](dockerfiles)

Using Helm:
 - Quickstart: `helm install spark-dashboard https://github.com/cerndb/spark-dashboard/raw/master/charts/spark-dashboard-0.3.0.tgz`
 - Details: [charts](charts)

## How use the dashboard to monitor Apache Spark

You will need to set a few Spark configuration parameter to use this type of instrumentation. 
In particular, you need to point Spark to write to the InfluxDB instance (to a Graphite endpoint).  

**Example** Spark configuration parameters:

```
# customize, as relevant for your system
INFLUXDB_ENDPOINT=`hostname`
#INFLUXDB_ENDPOINT=spark-dashboard-influx.default.svc.cluster.local
#INFLUXDB_ENDPOINT=10.0.0.1

bin/spark-shell (or spark-submit or pyspark) ...addtitional options...
--conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.class"="org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.GraphiteSink" \
--conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.host"=$INFLUXDB_ENDPOINT \
--conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.port"=2003 \
--conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.period"=10 \
--conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.unit"=seconds \
--conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.prefix"="luca" \
--conf "spark.metrics.conf.*.source.jvm.class"="org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource" \
--conf spark.metrics.appStatusSource.enabled=true \
```

**Graph annotations: display query/job/stage start and end times:**  
Optionally, you can add annotation instrumentation to the performance dashboard.
Annotations provide additional info on start and end times for queries, jobs and stages.
To activate annotations, add the following additional configuration, needed for collecting and writing extra performance data:
```
INFLUXDB_HTTP_ENDPOINT="http://`hostname`:8086"
#INFLUXDB_HTTP_ENDPOINT="http://10.0.0.1:8086"
--packages ch.cern.sparkmeasure:spark-measure_2.12:0.17 \
--conf spark.sparkmeasure.influxdbURL=$INFLUXDB_HTTP_ENDPOINT \
--conf spark.extraListeners=ch.cern.sparkmeasure.InfluxDBSink \
```

**Notes:**
- More details on how this works and alternative configurations at [Spark Dashboard](https://github.com/LucaCanali/Miscellaneous/tree/master/Spark_Dashboard)
- The dashboard can be used when running Spark on a cluster (Kubernetes, YARN, Standalone, Mesos) or in local mode.
  When using Spark in local mode, please use Spark version 3.1 or higher, see [SPARK-31711](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31711)
- The configuration in the example below is done using `spark.metrics.conf...` parameters, as an alternative
  you can choose to configure the metrics system using the configuration file `$SPARK_HOME/conf/metrics.properties file`

**Docker:**
- InfluxDB will use port 2003 (graphite endpoint), and port 8086 (http endpoint) of
  your machine/VM (when running using `--network=host`).
- Note: the endpoints need to be available on the node where you started the Docker container and
  reachable by Spark executors and driver (mind the firewall).

**Helm:**
- Find the InfluxDB endpoint IP with `kubectl get service spark-dashboard-influx`.
  Optionally resolve the dns name with `nslookup` of such IP.
  For example, the InfluxDB service host name of a test installation is: `spark-dashboard-influx.default.svc.cluster.local`

## How to connect to the Grafana dashboard

Docker:
 - The Grafana dashboard is reachable at port 3000 of your machine/VM (when running using `--network=host`)

Helm:
 - The Grafana dashboard is reachable at port 3000 of the spark-dashboard-service.  
   See service details: `kubectl get service spark-dashboard-grafana`  
   When using NodePort and an internal cluster IP address, this is how you can port forward to the service from
   the local machine: `kubectl port-forward service/spark-dashboard-grafana 3000:3000`

Examples:
- See some [examples of the graphs available in the dashboard at this link](https://github.com/LucaCanali/Miscellaneous/tree/master/Spark_Dashboard#example-graphs)

Notes:
- First logon: use user "admin", with password admin (you can change that after logon)
- Choose one of the provided dashboards (for example start with **Spark_Perf_Dashboard_v03**) and select the user,
  applicationId and timerange.
- You will need a running Spark application configured to use the dashboard to be able to select and application
  and display the metrics.
 
## Customizing and adding new dashboards 

The provided example dashboards are examples based on the authors' usage. Only a subset of the metrics values logged into 
InfluxDB are visualized in the provided dashboard.
For a full list of the available metrics see the
[documentation of Spark metrics system](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/monitoring.md#metrics).
New dashboards can be added by putting them in the relevant `grafana_dashboards` folder and re-building the container image
(or  re-packaging the helm chart).
On Helm: running helm-update is enough to upload it as ConfigMap and make it available to Grafana. 
Automatically persisting manual edits is not supported at this time.
